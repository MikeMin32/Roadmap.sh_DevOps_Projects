# Prometheus and Grafana Monitoring Stack

## Overview
Deploy a complete monitoring solution with Prometheus and Grafana.

## Skill Level
Advanced

## Domain
Monitoring / Observability

## Objectives
- Build production-grade monitoring
- Implement comprehensive metrics collection
- Create advanced dashboards
- Set up complex alerting rules

## Project Requirements
Deploy full monitoring stack:
- Prometheus server with high availability
- Multiple exporters (node, blackbox, custom)
- Grafana with multiple data sources
- AlertManager for alert routing
- Service discovery integration
- Long-term metrics storage (Thanos/Cortex)
- Custom metrics and exporters
- Complex PromQL queries
- Advanced dashboards and visualizations
- Alert routing and aggregation
- Recording rules for optimization
- Federation for multi-cluster monitoring

## Suggested Technologies
- Prometheus
- Grafana
- AlertManager
- Thanos or Cortex
- Various exporters
- Docker/Kubernetes
- Nginx for proxying

## Learning Outcomes
- Prometheus architecture
- PromQL mastery
- Advanced dashboard design
- Alert rule engineering
- Metrics federation
- Long-term storage solutions
- High availability monitoring

## Next Steps
After completing this project, try:
- Adding log aggregation (Loki)
- Implementing distributed tracing (Tempo)
- Creating SLO/SLA dashboards
- Adding anomaly detection
- Implementing correlation between metrics, logs, and traces
