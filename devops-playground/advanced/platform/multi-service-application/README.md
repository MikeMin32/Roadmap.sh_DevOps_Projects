# Multi-Service Platform Application

## Overview
Build a complete platform with multiple interconnected microservices.

## Skill Level
Advanced

## Domain
Platform Engineering / Microservices

## Objectives
- Design complex distributed systems
- Implement platform engineering practices
- Create production-ready infrastructure
- Master orchestration and automation

## Project Requirements
Build comprehensive platform with:
- Multiple microservices (5+ services)
- API Gateway and service mesh
- Kubernetes orchestration
- CI/CD pipelines for all services
- Centralized logging (ELK or Loki)
- Distributed tracing (Jaeger/Zipkin)
- Monitoring stack (Prometheus/Grafana)
- Message broker (Kafka/RabbitMQ)
- Databases (SQL and NoSQL)
- Caching layer (Redis)
- Authentication and authorization
- Secrets management (Vault)
- Infrastructure as Code
- Auto-scaling policies
- Disaster recovery plan

## Suggested Technologies
- Kubernetes
- Istio or Linkerd
- Multiple programming languages
- ELK Stack or Grafana Loki
- Prometheus & Grafana
- Kafka or RabbitMQ
- HashiCorp Vault
- Terraform or Pulumi
- GitOps (ArgoCD or Flux)

## Learning Outcomes
- Platform engineering principles
- Kubernetes in production
- Microservices architecture at scale
- Observability in distributed systems
- GitOps workflows
- Service mesh concepts
- Cloud-native patterns

## Next Steps
After completing this project, try:
- Implementing multi-region deployment
- Adding chaos engineering
- Creating developer platform (IDP)
- Implementing FinOps practices
- Adding machine learning pipelines
