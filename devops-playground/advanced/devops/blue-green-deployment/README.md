# Blue-Green Deployment

## Overview
Implement blue-green deployment strategy for zero-downtime releases.

## Skill Level
Advanced

## Domain
DevOps / Deployment Strategies

## Objectives
- Master advanced deployment patterns
- Implement zero-downtime deployments
- Configure automated rollback
- Manage traffic routing

## Project Requirements
Create blue-green deployment system:
- Set up two identical production environments (blue/green)
- Implement load balancer for traffic switching
- Automate deployment to inactive environment
- Create smoke tests for new deployment
- Implement instant traffic cutover
- Configure automated rollback on failure
- Monitor both environments
- Implement database migration strategy
- Create deployment pipeline
- Add feature flags for gradual rollout

## Suggested Technologies
- Kubernetes or Docker Swarm
- Load balancer (Nginx, HAProxy, AWS ALB)
- CI/CD tool (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
- Monitoring (Prometheus, Datadog)
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

## Learning Outcomes
- Blue-green deployment pattern
- Zero-downtime deployment strategies
- Traffic management
- Rollback mechanisms
- Database migration strategies
- Deployment automation at scale

## Next Steps
After completing this project, try:
- Implementing canary deployments
- Adding A/B testing capability
- Creating multi-region deployments
- Implementing progressive delivery
- Adding chaos engineering tests
