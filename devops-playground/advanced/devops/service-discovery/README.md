# Service Discovery

## Overview
Implement service discovery for dynamic microservices environments.

## Skill Level
Advanced

## Domain
DevOps / Microservices

## Objectives
- Understand service discovery patterns
- Implement dynamic service registration
- Configure health checking
- Manage distributed configuration

## Project Requirements
Build service discovery infrastructure:
- Deploy service registry (Consul, etcd, or Eureka)
- Implement service registration on startup
- Configure health checks for services
- Set up DNS-based service discovery
- Implement client-side load balancing
- Configure distributed configuration management
- Add service deregistration on shutdown
- Implement failover and circuit breakers
- Create service mesh (optional)
- Monitor service health and availability

## Suggested Technologies
- Consul, etcd, or Eureka
- Microservices (multiple languages)
- Docker or Kubernetes
- Load balancer (Nginx, Envoy)
- Service mesh (Istio, Linkerd) optional

## Learning Outcomes
- Service discovery patterns
- Service registry concepts
- Health checking mechanisms
- Dynamic configuration
- Distributed systems coordination
- Microservices communication

## Next Steps
After completing this project, try:
- Implementing full service mesh
- Adding distributed tracing
- Implementing advanced load balancing
- Adding API gateway with discovery
- Creating multi-datacenter setup
