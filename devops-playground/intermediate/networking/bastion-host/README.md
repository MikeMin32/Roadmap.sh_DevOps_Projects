# Bastion Host Setup

## Overview
Configure a bastion host for secure access to private infrastructure.

## Skill Level
Intermediate

## Domain
Networking / Security

## Objectives
- Understand bastion host architecture
- Implement secure jump server
- Configure network segmentation
- Set up SSH tunneling

## Project Requirements
Set up bastion host infrastructure:
- Deploy bastion host in public subnet
- Configure private instances in private subnet
- Set up SSH jump host configuration
- Implement SSH agent forwarding
- Configure security groups/firewall rules
- Set up SSH logging and auditing
- Implement IP whitelisting
- Configure session recording
- Set up multi-factor authentication (optional)

## Suggested Technologies
- AWS/DigitalOcean/GCP
- OpenSSH
- VPC/Networking
- fail2ban
- Session recording tools (asciinema, script)

## Learning Outcomes
- Network segmentation
- Jump host patterns
- SSH configuration advanced topics
- Security hardening
- Access control best practices

## Next Steps
After completing this project, try:
- Implementing SSH certificate authority
- Setting up VPN as alternative
- Adding intrusion detection
- Implementing just-in-time access
- Creating automated access audits
