# Infrastructure as Code with DigitalOcean

## Overview
Use Terraform to provision and manage infrastructure on DigitalOcean.

## Skill Level
Intermediate

## Domain
Terraform / Infrastructure as Code

## Objectives
- Learn Terraform fundamentals
- Write declarative infrastructure code
- Manage state files
- Implement modules and workspaces

## Project Requirements
Create Terraform configuration to:
- Provision DigitalOcean droplets
- Set up networking (VPC, firewalls)
- Configure load balancers
- Manage DNS records
- Set up databases (managed PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- Use variables and outputs
- Implement remote state storage (S3, Terraform Cloud)
- Create reusable modules
- Apply security groups and SSH keys

## Suggested Technologies
- Terraform
- DigitalOcean
- Git for version control
- Terraform Cloud or S3 for state

## Learning Outcomes
- HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)
- Infrastructure state management
- Resource dependencies
- Terraform lifecycle
- Module development
- State locking and versioning

## Next Steps
After completing this project, try:
- Implementing multiple environments (dev, staging, prod)
- Using Terragrunt for DRY configurations
- Creating automated testing for infrastructure
- Implementing drift detection
- Multi-cloud deployments
