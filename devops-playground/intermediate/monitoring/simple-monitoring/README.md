# Simple Monitoring Setup

## Overview
Set up basic monitoring for servers and applications.

## Skill Level
Intermediate

## Domain
Monitoring / Observability

## Objectives
- Understand monitoring fundamentals
- Collect and visualize metrics
- Configure alerting
- Create dashboards

## Project Requirements
Implement monitoring solution with:
- Metrics collection (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Application metrics (response time, error rates)
- Visualization dashboard
- Alerting rules and notifications
- Log aggregation (optional)
- Uptime monitoring
- Historical data retention
- Multiple target systems

## Suggested Technologies
- Prometheus + Grafana
- Node Exporter, cAdvisor
- AlertManager
- Or alternatives: Netdata, Zabbix, Nagios

## Learning Outcomes
- Monitoring architecture
- Metrics collection and aggregation
- Query languages (PromQL)
- Alert rule creation
- Dashboard design
- SLO/SLA concepts

## Next Steps
After completing this project, try:
- Adding distributed tracing
- Implementing custom metrics exporters
- Setting up log analysis (ELK stack)
- Creating advanced alert rules
- Implementing anomaly detection
