# Node.js Service Deployment

## Overview
Create a CI/CD pipeline to automatically deploy a Node.js service.

## Skill Level
Intermediate

## Domain
CI/CD / Deployment Automation

## Objectives
- Build complete CI/CD pipelines
- Implement automated testing
- Configure deployment strategies
- Manage application environments

## Project Requirements
Set up CI/CD pipeline with:
- Node.js application (Express, Nest.js, etc.)
- GitHub Actions or GitLab CI
- Automated testing (unit, integration)
- Code quality checks (ESLint, Prettier)
- Security scanning (npm audit)
- Docker image building
- Automated deployment to cloud (AWS, DigitalOcean, Heroku)
- Environment-specific configurations (dev, staging, prod)
- Rollback mechanism
- Deployment notifications (Slack, email)

## Suggested Technologies
- Node.js
- GitHub Actions or GitLab CI
- Docker
- Cloud platform (AWS, DigitalOcean)
- Jest/Mocha for testing

## Learning Outcomes
- CI/CD pipeline design
- Automated testing strategies
- Deployment automation
- Environment management
- Pipeline debugging

## Next Steps
After completing this project, try:
- Implementing blue-green deployments
- Adding canary releases
- Creating preview environments for PRs
- Implementing infrastructure as code
- Adding performance testing
