# Multi-Service Application

## Overview
Deploy a microservices-based application using Docker.

## Skill Level
Intermediate

## Domain
Docker / Microservices

## Objectives
- Understand microservices architecture
- Implement service-to-service communication
- Configure API gateway
- Manage distributed systems

## Project Requirements
Build a microservices application with:
- Multiple independent services (3+)
- API Gateway (Kong/Nginx/Traefik)
- Service discovery
- Shared database or per-service databases
- Inter-service communication (REST/gRPC)
- Centralized logging
- Distributed tracing (optional)
- Docker Compose orchestration
- Load balancing
- Health monitoring

## Suggested Technologies
- Docker & Docker Compose
- API Gateway (Kong, Nginx, Traefik)
- Multiple programming languages
- Message broker (RabbitMQ, Kafka)
- Database(s)

## Learning Outcomes
- Microservices design patterns
- API gateway patterns
- Service communication protocols
- Distributed system challenges
- Container orchestration at scale

## Next Steps
After completing this project, try:
- Implementing circuit breaker pattern
- Adding service mesh (Istio, Linkerd)
- Implementing event-driven architecture
- Adding distributed tracing (Jaeger, Zipkin)
- Migrating to Kubernetes
