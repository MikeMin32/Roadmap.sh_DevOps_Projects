## Overview
Build and deploy a multi-tier application using Docker Compose.

## Skill Level
Intermediate

## Domain
Docker / Application Architecture

## Objectives
- Design multi-tier architectures
- Implement service communication
- Configure reverse proxies
- Manage application lifecycle

## Project Requirements
Create a multi-container application with:
- Frontend (React/Vue/Angular)
- Backend API (Node.js/Python/Go)
- Database (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- Reverse proxy (Nginx/Traefik)
- Docker Compose orchestration
- Inter-service communication
- Shared networks and volumes
- Environment-specific configurations
- Health checks for all services
- Graceful shutdown handling

## Suggested Technologies
- Docker & Docker Compose

- Backend framework of choice
- Nginx or Traefik
- Database of choice

## Learning Outcomes
- Multi-tier architecture design
- Service discovery and networking
- Reverse proxy configuration
- Container orchestration patterns
- Zero-downtime deployments

## Next Steps
After completing this project, try:
- Adding message queue (RabbitMQ/Kafka)
- Implementing service mesh
- Adding monitoring and logging stack
- Creating CI/CD pipeline
- Migrating to Kubernetes
